## Recipefinder Application
A Rails app that will display a recipe index page based on a search keyword entered

The overall goal of this assignment is to implement a Rails application using model, view, and controller classes.

*the model class will access information
*the view class will display information and accept commands from the user
*the controller class will implement actions through  internal service logic and the delegation to model and view classes.

The functional goal is to provide web page access to recipe information served by http://food2fork.com/api through  JSON and images.
Documentation for the API can be found at http://food2fork.com/about/api. 

The app is deployed using Heroku and can be accessed at http://recipefinder454.herokuapp.com
